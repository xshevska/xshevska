<h1 align="center">Hi there, I'm  <a href="https://daniilshat.ru/" target="_blank">Miroslavka</a> 
<img src="https://github.com/blackcater/blackcater/raw/main/images/Hi.gif" height="32"/></h1>
<h3 align="center">I am studying in Bratislava at the STU in the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. I am from Ukraine. And I'm very happy to see you here. </h3>


🔭 I'm currently engaged in the fascinating journey of learning Java and the principles of Object-Oriented Programming - the complexity of the discipline has sparked my interest and ignited my passion for coding!
<br />
🌱 Currently, my learning palette includes JAVA, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and Spring Boot - each language a different tool, each adding a unique color to my coding canvas.
<br />
👩🏻‍💻 Looking ahead, I aspire to apply my skills in a practical setting as a web developer - to create, to innovate, and to make an impact.
